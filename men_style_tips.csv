Rectangle,"Look for structured blazers and fitted jackets with slight shoulder padding to broaden the shoulders. Layering can also enhance the depthâ€”try layering fitted T-shirts or shirts under sweaters or vests to give your upper body more volume. Patterns, like horizontal stripes, and details around the chest area can also draw attention to your upper body.","straight-fit or slim-fit trousers to avoid much width of the hips. Choosing well-fitted bottoms helps ensure that your look stays sharp and clean, without additional dimensions that could detract from the overall shape.","Steer clear of boxy or overly loose clothing that may emphasize the natural rectangular silhouette. Such pieces can make your frame look even straighter, losing the definition you want to create around the waist and shoulders."
Triangle,"To broaden the shoulders, V-neck sweaters or dress shirts, and structured jackets with slight padding in the shoulders work wonders. A V-neck helps elongate the neck and draws the eye upward, enhancing the shoulders and chest. Opt for tops in lighter colors or with subtle vertical patterns to emphasize the upper body without adding bulk to the waist","Choose straight-leg or slightly tapered pants or chinos in dark, muted tones to keep the focus away from the waist and hips. Darker colors can visually slim the lower half, creating a more blended look.","Steer clear of tight or skinny-fit trousers that cling to the waist and hips, as they can exaggerate a triangle shape and emphasize width around the hips. Also, avoid bulky tops with extra fabric around the waist to keep the upper body looking sharp, opting instead for fitted shirts or polos."
Inverted Triangle,"Choose slim-fit shirts, polos, and T-shirts made from lightweight fabrics that prevent the shoulders and chest from appearing too broad. Opt for tops in darker colors or with subtle patterns that keep the focus balanced.","To put volume to the lower body, tapered or slim-fit trousers and jeans are an excellent choice. These styles help improve the silhouette without drawing too much attention to the narrow waist. Mid-wash or slightly lighter-colored pants can further add visual weight to the lower half, creating a cohesive look.","Stay away from any extra padding or thick, textured fabrics on top that make the upper body look disproportionately large. Additionally, avoid ultra-skinny trousers that could make your lower body appear even narrower. Instead, classic fits in trousers allow for ease of movement and a naturally attractive look."
Oval,"Darker colors and vertical stripes are your best allies. A custom dark blazer or tailored jacket is ideal, as structured shoulders can boost harmony for the whole body. Look for dress shirts with a slim (but not tight) fit to follow your frame comfortably while providing a polished look. Vertical patterns subtly elongate the torso, creating a slimming effect.","Opt for flat-front trousers with a straight-leg cut to enhance the appearance without drawing attention to the midsection. Darker color dress trousers or chinos can provide the perfect fit for a refined, streamlined appearance. Mid-rise pants are particularly effective, as they help elongate the legs and avoid emphasizing the midsection.","Steer clear of tight or clingy fabrics around the waist, which can draw attention to the midsection. Avoid low-waist trousers, as they can make the torso appear shorter and improve the visual width of the waist area."
Trapezoid,"Well-fitted shirts and tailored blazers are ideal for showcasing the natural proportions of the Trapezoid shape, especially classic cuts and versatile colors that allow you to maintain a crisp, structured look that flatters your frame. Fitted T-shirts and polos also work well, as they highlight the chest and shoulders while tapering at the waist for a smooth silhouette.","Besides slim-fit bottoms, athletic-fit trousers work well to complement the upper body without creating too much contrast. Shades like navy, grey, or brown provide a classic base that completes a proportionate look. Consider mid-rise pants that sit comfortably and accentuate your natural build.","Loose or overly baggy clothing can disrupt the proportionate silhouette, creating unnecessary bulk and detracting from the balanced look. Stick to tailored, streamlined fits that allow you to showcase your athletic build."
